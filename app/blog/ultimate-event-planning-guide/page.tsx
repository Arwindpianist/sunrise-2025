          <h3>Phase 1: Discovery & Strategy (Months 6-12)</h3>
          <p>
            This foundational phase involves understanding your event's purpose, target audience, and desired outcomes. Key activities include defining event objectives and success metrics, conducting market research and competitor analysis, establishing budget and resource requirements, and creating initial timeline and milestone plans. This phase sets the direction for everything that follows.

            Transform your strategy into actionable plans and creative concepts. This phase includes developing event theme and visual identity, creating detailed project schedules and workflows, designing attendee experience journey maps, and planning content and programming structure. The focus is on translating ideas into concrete, executable plans.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Phase 3: Execution & Coordination (Months 2-4)</h3>
          <p>
            The most intensive phase where plans become reality.

Your preparation pays off during this critical phase.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Phase 5: Post-Event & Analysis (Weeks 1-4)</h3>

            Critical for learning and improving future events. This phase includes conducting comprehensive post-event analysis, gathering attendee feedback and testimonials, measuring ROI and success metrics, and planning follow-up engagement and community building. The insights gained here inform your next event planning cycle.
